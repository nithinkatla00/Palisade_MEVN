  <h5 class="card-header">About NodeJs</h5>

    <h5 class="card-title">Why is Nodejs becoming Popular</h5><br>
    <p>The popular backend server</p>
    <p class="card-text">
        <ul>
            <li>Really Fast</li>
            <p>As NodeJS is powered maintained by Googleâ€™s Chromium V8. It compiles and executes JavaScript into native machine code which makes this process very quick. Node uses an Asynchronous system which makes it even better choice for a simultaneous working method. When the application has to perform I/O operation it sends the asynchronous task and callback action to the event loop and continues to perform the rest of the program when sync is done then it automatically returns to the task at hand.</p>
            <li>JavaScript is Infinite</li>
            <p>As we already aware with JavaScript that it great community support, loads of rich features set, along with the built-in features that make it fast compared to other programming stuff, we need to know at least some of about JavaScript. Such a JavaScript developer programmer has enough knowledge to migrate to NodeJS development. To be a NodeJS developer will definitely a very promising step for a newbie, as Node can handle all the stress if a company decides to change their logic built for the browser to a server.</p>
            <li>No language restriction</li>
            <p>The bridge is required between the front-end and back-end system that has been a roadblock to superior functionality. Generally, we need to use two different languages to build the front-end and back-end of the required system or the application, whether it should be PHP, Python for the back-end or the HTML, CSS for the front-end web technologies. This restriction is being removed by NodeJS, NodeJS developers have the freedom of only have to learn JavaScript across all the layers of the web development. Majorly Node is used to develop web application yet mobile app are also possible to build.</p>
            <li>Flawless Solution for Real-time Application</li>
            <p>NodeJS is just perfect solution fit for application where you had need even-based server along with non-blocking driven approach. As it gives freedom to share some code between server-side and client-side, this makes NodeJS a very essential platform for creating a real-time application such as Chat application, Online game application, and Live tracking etc. When there would be a need to transfer the live data from server to browser and vise-versa then the only choice is NodeJS.</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Declarative</li>
            <p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
            <li>Component-Based</li>
            <p>Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>
